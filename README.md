# face-recognition-using-C-visual-studio-2017-using EMGUCV dlls.
Detect multiple face and recognize them using C# code in visual studio, Windows Application.

This method uses EignefaceRecognizer to datect and recognize the facethrough webcam.

FaceDetAndRecog.txt is a c# script attached.
Copy whole text from that FaceDetAndRecog.txt, paste in your project's .cs file.
In design part, drop a image box (initially will not be available in toolbox, impiort or install it (simple process!!) ) and a save button and text box where the detected face's name is inputted through text box and saved in a local folder under bin/debug called Faces.
Create Face.txt file in the same directory.

as this works using emgucv so copy al dlls and .xml file to bin/debug folder.

For better results save each face more times with same "name"....
(Analyze the code its simple as that)
